It was only when Mr. Lag suggested actually rebuilding the maps that the project sparkled in late 2014.
The goal was to have a LOT of comparison between all the cars, where the usual winners would loose, which maps are impossible with some cars, and so on.
After a couple of weeks, a tool was used to change the car simply, instead of rebuilding the maps... 6 times!
Since then, a dozen players helped us process and validate Nadeo maps from all old TM games, and over 2,000 tracks have been uploaded on TMX, and countless replays.
ManiaPlanet offers a lot more potential for this, with native EnviMix and Title Packs, which made the challenge possible like never before." autonewline="1" textsize="2"/>

I started a Trackmania YouTube channel in 2014, back then never dreaming of creating something big as a title pack, never dreaming of staying with Trackmania for over 4 years.

My main focus was always the YouTube. By meaning that recently my 200th video was released. xD It became a norm for me, a great norm full of enjoyment. And I'm happy to continue for the next years.

I tried almost everything in Trackmania and there's still something fun that keeps me playing it for thousands of hours. Although what I know is that Nadeo maps always had a special place in my heart.

Besides Trackmania, currently I'm quite enjoying producing music as it's a different way of expressing the feelings. The title pack also uses a song and sound effects made by me. Honest is my producer name because numbers suck and I suck at naming. xD

I started to look around programming about 5 or 6 years ago and the experience over the years really helped me with the development of this title pack. There were so many things needed to learn/understand and I'm just overall so happy that the first title pack I ever organized is nearly finished!" autonewline="1" textsize="1"/>

Unlike BigBang, I'm not on the creative side. My fields are rather listing, archiving, doing stats.

I have started a few projects revolving around Nadeo maps, mainly Nadeo Reverse, inspired by JaV, and Nadeo EnviMix.

I have also listed all and every single Nadeo maps officially released and their versions in an epic 68 min video, Nadeo Maps Archives." autonewline="1" textsize="2"/>
